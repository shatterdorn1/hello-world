Learning how to Git Gud
My name is Truman Dorn, I am a Professional woodworker and craftsman turned aspiring Web Designer/Developer. I have worked on many multi-million dollar projects with difficult deadlines and complex and very detailed work in my previous industry, and that combined with my love of technology and computers gives me a good head start to become an efficient developer. I have self-taught experience with HTML5, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and Wordpress.
